# NEA-Coursework

This my computer science course work by OCR. Since the coursework got leaked, the examination has been changed to 100% exam and 0% coursework. Therefore, I decided to make my own version of the coursework as it did not count.

I was given around a year, and I completed it in around 10 hours.

This program has more than 1000 lines of code which is probably the most in the entire country..

If you would like to try out the program, go to the Release tab.

Also, i'll be declining pull requests as it is and should only be my own work.
